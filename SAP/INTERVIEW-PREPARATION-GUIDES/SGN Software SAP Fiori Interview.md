## 🧩 **1. Tell Me About Yourself (Final Version for SGN Software – Fiori/UI5 Consultant)**

“Good afternoon sir/ma’am. My name is Smruti Ranjan Mohapatra. I’ve completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering and recently finished my SAP ABAP and SAP Fiori training under Skill Odisha.

I’m an SAP Certified Associate in both *SAP Fiori Application Development* and *SAP ABAP Cloud (Back-End Developer)*. During my learning and internship phase, I built full-stack RAP-based applications like *Employee Master* and *Inventory Management*, handling both backend logic and frontend integration.

I worked on CDS Views, behavior definitions, and OData V4 services in ABAP Cloud, and then integrated them with SAP Fiori Elements UIs using SAP Business Application Studio on BTP Cloud Foundry.

I enjoy working on Fiori and UI5 because it combines both logic and design — developing user-friendly interfaces backed by efficient data models.
Now, I’m looking for an opportunity at SGN Software to apply these skills in real-time client projects, strengthen my technical experience, and grow as an SAP Fiori/UI5 Consultant.”

🧠 *Tip:* Say this confidently, maintaining a conversational tone — not too fast, and smile briefly when you mention your certifications.

---
## 🙋‍♂️ **2. Tell Me About Your projects:**

“I’ve worked on two full-stack RAP-based Fiori applications — *Employee Master* and *Inventory Management*.

In both projects, I handled the complete flow — from backend logic in RAP to frontend integration in Fiori.
On the backend, I created custom tables, CDS views, and behavior definitions to manage CRUD operations, then exposed the data as OData V4 services.

On the frontend, I used SAP Business Application Studio to generate Fiori Elements UIs like List Report and Object Page, connected them to the OData services, and deployed everything on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry with HANA Cloud as the database.

These projects helped me understand how the backend and UI work together in SAP’s cloud environment and gave me hands-on experience in RAP, CDS, OData, and Fiori Elements.”

🧩 **Keywords:** RAP | CDS Views | Behavior Definition | OData V4 | Fiori Elements | BAS | Cloud Foundry | HANA Cloud | End-to-End Integration

---

## 💻 **Q1. Explain your Employee Master RAP project in detail**

**Answer:**
“My Employee Master project is a full-stack RAP-based Fiori application designed to manage employee information like Employee ID, Name, Department, and Salary.

On the **backend**, I used the *RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming)* model in a *managed scenario*. I started by creating a custom database table in the ABAP environment. Then, I built **Core Data Services (CDS) Views** — first a *root view entity* and then a *projection view* — to define how data is modeled and exposed.

Next, I defined a **behavior definition** to enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Since it’s a managed scenario, the RAP framework automatically handled the transactional logic.

After that, I created a **service definition** and **service binding**, which exposed the data as an **OData V4 service**. This allowed the data to be consumed easily by the frontend.

On the **frontend**, I used **SAP Business Application Studio (BAS)** to generate a Fiori Elements application based on the OData V4 service. Using the *List Report* and *Object Page* templates, I could create a UI automatically with minimal coding effort.

Finally, I deployed the application to **SAP BTP Cloud Foundry**, tested CRUD operations through the Fiori preview, and verified data persistence in the HANA Cloud database.

This project gave me a complete understanding of how backend logic and frontend integration come together in SAP’s cloud environment.”

🧩 **Keywords to emphasize:**
RAP Managed Scenario | CDS Root & Projection Views | Behavior Definition | OData V4 | Fiori Elements | BAS | Cloud Foundry | CRUD Operations | End-to-End Integration

---

## 💻 **Q2. Explain your Inventory Management Project**

**Answer:**
“My Inventory Management project is also a full-stack RAP-based Fiori application that tracks product stock levels, suppliers, and material details.

In the backend, I created multiple custom tables for products and suppliers, defined **associations** between them in CDS Views, and used **behavior definitions** to manage stock updates automatically.

After exposing the data as an **OData V4 service** via service definition and binding, I used **Fiori Elements** in BAS to create a responsive List Report and Object Page app for users to view, add, or modify inventory details.

The app was deployed on **SAP BTP Cloud Foundry**, with **HANA Cloud** as the database. I also added custom annotations to enhance the UI — for example, to show product status indicators and sort/filter options in the List Report view.

This project helped me understand real-time data flow between backend RAP services and the Fiori UI, as well as deployment and testing in the SAP cloud environment.”

🧩 **Keywords:**
CDS Associations | Behavior Definition | RAP | OData V4 | Fiori Elements | List Report | Object Page | Annotations | Cloud Foundry | BAS | HANA Cloud

---

## 💬 **Bonus: If they ask “What’s the difference between both projects?”**

**Answer:**
“The Employee Master app focused on managing employee data and mastering CRUD operations through RAP and Fiori Elements, while the Inventory Management app included multiple tables with associations and more complex logic for stock updates. Both projects strengthened my understanding of full-stack SAP development using RAP, OData, and Fiori Elements.”

---

## 💬 **If asked about your environment/tools**

**Answer:**
“I worked mainly in SAP Business Application Studio on BTP. For the backend, I used RAP on ABAP Cloud with HANA as the database. For testing and validation, I used Postman to check OData responses and the Fiori Elements preview in BAS for the UI layer.”
